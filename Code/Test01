Since 2022, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting:

Cisco UCS-X / Intersight platform: ~30–60 CVEs

HPE Gen11/Gen12 + OneView/iLO stack: ~40–80 CVEs

Patch response times:

Cisco: fixes commonly released same-day to a few weeks after advisory publication.

HPE: firmware and iLO security patches generally within days to weeks, in some cases fix available pre-advisory.

Operational impact:

Both vendors show active security maintenance — CVE count reflects visibility rather than weakness.

Risk depends mainly on update discipline, firmware cadence, and management network isolation, not just vendor choice.
